Java Throwable class is the root class in the hierarchy. It
Splits into Error and Exception
a. java.lang.Error - Error represents irrecoverable conditions such as Java
virtual machine (JVM) running out of memory, memory leaks, stack
overflow errors, library incompatibility, infinite recursion, etc.
b. java.lang.Exception - Exceptions can be caught and handled by the
program.
I. When an exception occurs, it creates an object. This object is called the
exception object.
Ii. It contains information about the exception such as the name and
description of the exception and the state of the program when the
exception occurred.

- The Exception class is further divided into
RuntimeException which are Unchecked Exceptions and Checked Exceptions like
IOException.
a. java.lang.RuntimeException: These exceptions are raised during runtime due
to programming errors. They are not checked at compile time and hence are also
called unchecked exceptions. Some examples are
I. Improper use of an API - IllegalArgumentException
ii. Null pointer access (missing the initialization of a variable) -
NullPointerException
iii. Out-of-bounds array access - ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
Iv. Dividing a number by 0 - ArithmeticException
